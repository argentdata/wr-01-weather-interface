# WR-01 JSON parsing demo
# S. Miller 3 June 2025
#
# This Python script provides a simple demonstration of reading and parsing
# data in JSON format from the Argent Data Systems WR-01 wind/rain sensor
# interface.
#
# The WR-01 must be configured for JSON output mode. For the TTL/RS-232 port,
# set register 20 to value 32 (command "!20=32"). For the RS-485 port,
# set register 18 to value 32 (command "!18=32"). Be sure to use the "!save"
# command to save the setting.
#
# This script demonstrates the basics of reading a single line from the
# serial port, parsing the line as JSON, and extracting a few values.
# wind_dir and wind_speed values are grouped by averaging intervals under
# "instant", "2min", "10min", and "custom". "gust" gives the peak wind speed
# in the 2min, 10min, and custom groups. Rainfall values are reported
# as "rain_1hr", "rain24_hr", "rain_total", and "last rain". Units are
# meters/second for speeds, degrees for directions, millimeters for rain,
# and minutes for time since last rain.

            continue
